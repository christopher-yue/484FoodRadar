### Goal of Project
Create a web application using the MERN stack that allows people to view restaurants based on rating, type of cuisine, and distance and make reservations

### SETUP:

Clone the repository
Make sure you have the node package manager installed in your computer for this to work.
Open a new terminal and navigate to the backend folder then type npm install
Open a second terminal and navigate to the frontend folder then type npm install
Keep both terminals open
On the backend folder create a new folder named vars and inside the folder create a new file named .env (We'll be using the .env file for the development process).
Enter .env variables

### RUNNING AND TESTING:

Once that is all done, go back to your backend terminal and type npm run server
Next, go to your frontend terminal and type npm start
If everything goes well then your web browser should open up and you should see a login page
Test the login
You can also test failure if you modify the username or password
I have tested the backend post, get, delete, put calls using Postman and they are working fine
If you want to know how to set that up let me know here so you could check and test it as well.
If you wanna see what's in the database that I created, copy the DATABASE_URI link and paste it in MongoDB Compass.
